- This project is about building a NLP model that can be used for Named-Entity-Recognition in the field of Cybersecurity.
- MITRE Dataset is taken to train the model. The dataset is available in this repository as `MITRE.zip`. or Click [here](https://github.com/balnarendrasapa/cybersecurity-ner/raw/readme/MITRE.zip) to download the dataset.
- `distilbert-base-uncased` pretrained model was used in this project. This model is fine-tuned for this project's purpose.
